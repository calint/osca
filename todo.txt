[ ] frameless: encapsulate handling of field 'bits' in xin_.... functions
[ ] clonky: e.g. 1.3 MB instead of truncated to 1 MB
[ ] clonky: unit/s to use specified dt instead of assuming 1s
[ ] frameless: gracious handle of max windows reached
[ ] frameless: dynamic allocation of more xwins
[ ] stickyo: use of resources is exorbitant (35 MB  res - shared)
    => additional stickies consume much less resources
[ ] stickyo: save and remember state of stickies
[ ] frameless: capture button 3 and swipe up / down motion to switch desktop
[ ] frameless: capture button 3 and swipe left / right motion to switch focus
[ ] review menuq code
[ ] gtk.css: export GTK_DEBUG=interactive
[ ] clonky: valgrind
[ ] menuq: valgrind
[ ] menuq:  split path
            search for starts with in every path element
            display selectable options
            select using keyboard arrows

[ ] clang-tidy: maxed
[ ] frameless: different shades on desktop depending on id
--------------------------------------------------------------
[x] frameless: consider hiding windows from other desktops instead of "folding"
    them to the right
    => WIN_SLIP_DX and WIN_SLIP set to 0
[x] osca: xii volume and screen brightness controls
[x] frameless: capture XF86... keys
[x] review mounte code
    => deprecated
[x] frameless: if switching to a desktop without windows unfocus current window
    in previous desktop
    => setting input focus to root window
[-] frameless: study the possibility to capture a window creation
    event before it is mapped
    => the complications are too great. the hacky way of handling focus after
       mapping is satisfactory
[x] frameless: fix the focus when opening an application
    => it focuses on MapNotify and then ignores focus events for 500 ms
[x] frameless: when closing window and no focused windows on desk then focus
    on window under pointer
[x] review stickyo code
[x] frameless: resizing while entering a different window
[x] frameless: new window does not focus when pointer is in youtube screen area
[x] frameless: "scrot -s" to select screenshot area
[x] frameless: snapshot: select area
[x] review clonky code
[x] review frameless code
[x] stickyo: upgrade to gtk4
[-] stickyo: fix deprecations from gtk2 to gtk3
    => upgraded to gtk4
[x] frameless: debugging turned on with FRAMELESS_DEBUG define
[x] clonky: display IP addresses
[x] frameless: remember focused window on each desk
[x] frameless: review the somewhat messy state managing of focused windows
    and desktop changes
    => moved state handling from xwin_* to standalone functions
[x] clonky: throttle percentage display not same as in htop
    => throttle is the cpu frequency over max frequency, not cpu usage
[x] clonky: throttle line breaks after every 4 cpu
    => 5 fit in default width
[x] frameless: clang compile fix -Wno-sign-conversion
[x] clonky: render_io_stat: re-write considering loop devices
[x] clonky: net up/down in KB/s instead of total
[x] frameless: consolidate xwin.vh and bits into one field
