--------------------------------------------------------------
[x] frameless: remember focused window on each desk
[x] frameless: review the somewhat messy state managing of focused windows
    and desktop changes
    => moved state handling from xwin_* to standalone functions
[x] clonky: throttle percentage display not same as in htop
    => throttle is the cpu frequency over max frequency, not cpu usage
[x] clonky: throttle line breaks after every 4 cpu
    => 5 fit in default width
[x] frameless: clang compile fix -Wno-sign-conversion
[x] clonky: render_io_stat: re-write considering loop devices
[x] clonky: net up/down in KB/s instead of total
[x] frameless: consolidate xwin.vh and bits into one field
